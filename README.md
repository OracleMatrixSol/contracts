# OracleMatrix

**Slogan**: *Data-Driven Futures.*

OracleMatrix is a decentralized prediction platform built on Solana, leveraging the Model Context Protocol to deliver reliable, real-time data oracles for financial markets, sports, politics, weather, and more. By combining high-throughput blockchain technology with advanced data validation and governance mechanisms, OracleMatrix empowers users to shape the future through data-driven insights.

## Features

### Oracle System (Data On-Chain)
1. **Data Source Integration**
   - Supports diverse data types: financial, sports, political, weather, and custom feeds.
   - Integrates with professional APIs (e.g., Bloomberg, Reuters) and social media analytics.
   - Connects public and private data sources seamlessly.

2. **Validation Mechanism**
   - Decentralized network of validation nodes.
   - Multi-source data cross-verification.
   - Staking and incentive system for validators.
   - AI-assisted anomaly detection (placeholder for off-chain integration).

3. **Data Processing**
   - Intelligent parsing via Model Context Protocol (off-chain component).
   - Natural language processing for news and social media.
   - Real-time data stream handling.
   - Historical data analysis and pattern recognition.

4. **On-Chain Optimization**
   - Optimized for Solanaâ€™s high throughput.
   - Basic data compression algorithms.
   - Cost-efficient on-chain storage strategies.
   - Indexed data retrieval for fast access.

5. **Governance System**
   - Reputation scoring for data sources.
   - Community-driven voting and decision-making.
   - Dispute resolution framework.
   - Transparent audit trails.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [Solana CLI](https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools)
- [Anchor CLI](https://www.anchor-lang.com/docs/installation)
- Node.js and Yarn/npm

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/OracleMatrixSol/contracts.git
   cd oraclematrix
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Build the project:
   ```bash
   anchor build
   ```
4. Deploy to localnet (ensure Solana localnet is running):
   ```bash
   anchor deploy
   ```
5. Run tests:
   ```bash
   anchor test
   ```

### Project Structure
- `programs/oraclematrix/src/lib.rs`: Core Solana smart contract logic.
- `tests/oraclematrix.js`: Test suite for contract functionality.
- `Anchor.toml`: Anchor configuration file.
- `init_project.sh`: Setup script for initializing the project.

## Usage
1. **Initialize the Platform**: Deploy the `initialize` instruction to set up the config account.
2. **Register Data Sources**: Use `register_data_source` to onboard new data feeds.
3. **Submit Data**: Call `submit_data` to push real-time data on-chain.
4. **Validate Data**: Validators execute `validate_data` to verify submissions.
5. **Govern the System**: Adjust reputations with `update_reputation`.

For detailed instructions, refer to the [smart contract documentation](#) (to be added).

## Roadmap
- Integrate SPL tokens for staking and rewards.
- Develop off-chain oracle feeders for API and NLP integration.
- Enhance governance with a full DAO structure.
- Optimize data compression and storage for large-scale use.
